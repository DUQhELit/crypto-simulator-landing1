## What is a wallet?

A crypto wallet is a software application or hardware device that allows you to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies. Rather than holding coins themselves, wallets manage the **private keys** that prove ownership of blockchain addresses. Anyone who knows your private key can spend your funds, so protecting it is crucial.

## Hot vs cold wallets

- **Hot wallets** are connected to the internet. Examples include mobile apps, browser extensions and exchange accounts. They are convenient for frequent transactions but more vulnerable to hacking, malware and phishing attacks.
- **Cold wallets** are offline devices, such as hardware wallets (USB‑like devices) or paper wallets (QR codes on paper). Because they are not constantly online, they provide stronger protection against online threats. However, you must safeguard the device or paper to prevent loss or damage.

## Custodial vs non‑custodial

With **custodial** services, a third party (typically an exchange) holds your private keys on your behalf. This is simple for beginners because you only manage a username and password. However, you must trust the custodian to secure your funds and honour withdrawals. If the platform is hacked or goes bankrupt, you could lose access to your coins.

With **non‑custodial** wallets, you control your private keys directly. This provides maximum sovereignty over your assets but also full responsibility. If you misplace your seed phrase or private key, there is no customer support to recover it.

## Keeping your funds safe

To minimise risk:

1. Use a reputable hardware wallet for long‑term holdings.
2. Enable two‑factor authentication and strong passwords on exchange accounts.
3. Double‑check addresses before sending funds; scams often rely on typos or clipboard hijacking.
4. Keep your recovery seed phrase offline and store backups in separate secure locations.
5. Beware of phishing emails or websites that mimic legitimate services.

By understanding wallet types and security practices, you can participate in the crypto ecosystem with greater confidence.
