Trading cryptocurrencies can be a roller‑coaster ride. Prices can swing double‑digit percentages in a single day, stirring emotions like greed, fear, hope and regret. Successful traders recognise these psychological biases and adopt strategies to mitigate them.

### Common pitfalls

- **FOMO (fear of missing out):** Jumping into trades after prices have already moved significantly often leads to buying tops.
- **Panic selling:** Conversely, selling at the bottom during a market crash can lock in losses that might have been temporary.
- **Overtrading:** Constantly entering and exiting positions without a plan drains capital through fees and poor timing.

### Building discipline

1. Define your goals and risk tolerance before trading.
2. Use stop‑loss and take‑profit orders to automate exits rather than relying on emotions.
3. Keep a trading journal to review your decisions and learn from mistakes.
4. Take breaks; trading fatigue can cloud judgment.

By understanding your own psychology and establishing a structured approach, you improve your chances of long‑term success in crypto markets.
