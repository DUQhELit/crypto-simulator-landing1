Smart contracts are self‑executing agreements with the terms directly written into code and deployed on a blockchain. Once deployed, the contract runs exactly as programmed without the need for intermediaries or the risk of censorship. When predefined conditions are met, the contract automatically executes the relevant actions, such as transferring tokens or issuing an NFT.

### Why they matter

By removing the need for trusted third parties, smart contracts enable a wide range of decentralised applications. They power DeFi protocols, token issuance, supply‑chain tracking, gaming economies and more. Because the code is transparent and auditable, anyone can verify how a contract will behave.

### Limitations

Smart contracts cannot inherently access external data. To interact with off‑chain information (like price feeds or weather data), they rely on **oracles** — services that bridge the gap between blockchains and the outside world. Additionally, buggy code can lead to exploits, so rigorous testing and audits are essential before deploying contracts handling significant value.
