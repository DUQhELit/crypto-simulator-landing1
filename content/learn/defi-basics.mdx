Decentralised finance (DeFi) refers to a suite of financial applications built on public blockchains. Instead of relying on banks, brokers or clearing houses, DeFi protocols use smart contracts to automate transactions directly between users. This removes middlemen, reduces fees and allows anyone with an internet connection to access services like lending, borrowing, trading and yield farming.

### Key primitives

* **Automated market makers (AMMs):** Decentralised exchanges like Uniswap use liquidity pools to enable trading between token pairs. Prices adjust algorithmically based on supply and demand.
* **Lending platforms:** Protocols such as Aave and Compound let users deposit crypto to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Interest rates are set by supply and demand dynamics.
* **Stablecoins:** Tokens pegged to stable assets (e.g. US dollar) provide a less volatile medium of exchange within DeFi ecosystems.

While DeFi promises open access and innovation, it also carries risks like smart contract bugs, regulatory uncertainty and volatile token prices. Always do due diligence before interacting with protocols.
