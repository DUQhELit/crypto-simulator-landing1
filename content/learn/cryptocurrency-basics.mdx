## What is a cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets designed to work as mediums of exchange over the internet. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, they are not issued or controlled by a central authority. Instead, they rely on **blockchain** technology — a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers — to record transactions securely and transparently.

The first and most well‑known cryptocurrency is **Bitcoin**, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin introduced the idea of _digital scarcity_: only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and each unit can be subdivided infinitely. Since Bitcoin’s invention, thousands of alternative coins (altcoins) have emerged, each with unique features, such as smart contract functionality, privacy enhancements or improved transaction speeds.

## How does blockchain work?

A blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. When someone sends cryptocurrency to someone else, that transaction is broadcast to the network and bundled with other transactions into a block. Miners or validators then verify the block and add it to the chain. Once appended, the information is immutable — changing it would require altering every subsequent block, which becomes practically impossible on a large network.

Blockchains use **consensus mechanisms** to agree on which blocks are valid. Bitcoin employs proof‑of‑work, where miners solve computational puzzles. Other networks use proof‑of‑stake, where validators are chosen based on the amount of coins they stake as collateral. Each mechanism has trade‑offs in terms of security, energy use and decentralisation.

## Why do cryptocurrencies matter?

Cryptocurrencies enable peer‑to‑peer value transfer without relying on banks or payment processors. This can improve access to finance in regions with weak financial infrastructure. Additionally, blockchain applications extend beyond money: they power **decentralised finance (DeFi)** protocols that allow lending, borrowing and trading without intermediaries; **non‑fungible tokens (NFTs)** that represent digital art and collectibles; and even **supply chain** systems that track goods transparently.

While crypto markets are volatile and speculative, the underlying technology continues to inspire innovation. As with any investment, do thorough research and understand the risks before allocating funds to digital assets.
